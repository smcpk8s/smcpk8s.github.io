  <h2 id="traffic">Traffic Management</h2>
  <p>Istio’s traffic routing rules let you easily control the flow of traffic and API calls between services. Istio simplifies configuration of service-level properties like circuit breakers, timeouts, and retries, and makes it easy to set up important tasks like A/B testing, canary rollouts, and staged rollouts with percentage-based traffic splits. It also provides out-of-box failure recovery features that help make your application more robust against failures of dependent services or the network.<br>
  Istio’s traffic management model relies on the Envoy proxies that are deployed along with your services. All traffic that your mesh services send and receive (data plane traffic) is proxied through Envoy, making it easy to direct and control traffic around your mesh without making any changes to your services.<br>If you’re interested in the details of how the features described in this guide work, you can find out more about Istio’s traffic management implementation in the architecture overview. The rest of this guide introduces Istio’s traffic management features.</p>

<h2 id="introducing">Introducing Istio traffic management</h2>

<p> In order to direct traffic within your mesh, Istio needs to know where all your endpoints are, and which services they belong to. To populate its own service registry, Istio connects to a service discovery system. For example, if you’ve installed Istio on a Kubernetes cluster, then Istio automatically detects the services and endpoints in that cluster.<br>Using this service registry, the Envoy proxies can then direct traffic to the relevant services. Most microservice-based applications have multiple instances of each service workload to handle service traffic, sometimes referred to as a load balancing pool. By default, the Envoy proxies distribute traffic across each service’s load balancing pool using a round-robin model, where requests are sent to each pool member in turn, returning to the top of the pool once each service instance has received a request.<br>While Istio’s basic service discovery and load balancing gives you a working service mesh, it’s far from all that Istio can do. In many cases you might want more fine-grained control over what happens to your mesh traffic. You might want to direct a particular percentage of traffic to a new version of a service as part of A/B testing, or apply a different load balancing policy to traffic for a particular subset of service instances. You might also want to apply special rules to traffic coming into or out of your mesh, or add an external dependency of your mesh to the service registry. You can do all this and more by adding your own traffic configuration to Istio using Istio’s traffic management API.<br>Like other Istio configuration, the API is specified using Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs), which you can configure using YAML, as you’ll see in the examples.
The rest of this guide examines each of the traffic management API resources and what you can do with them. These resources are:</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p> Breaking down a monolithic application into atomic services offers various benefits, including better agility, better scalability and better ability to reuse services. However, microservices also have particular security needs:

To defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, they need traffic encryption.
To provide flexible service access control, they need mutual TLS and fine-grained access policies.
To determine who did what at what time, they need auditing tools.
Istio Security provides a comprehensive security solution to solve these issues. This page gives an overview on how you can use Istio security features to secure your services, wherever you run them. In particular, Istio security mitigates both insider and external threats against your data, endpoints, communication, and platform.</p>
